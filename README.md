## Notes

Managing all the React hooks used within the app was quite challenging. The large number of hooks made it somewhat confusing to keep track of their purposes. Another challenge was ensuring that the text input box only had a border color after the user made a guess. To deal with this challenge, I created a hook that kept track of whether or not the user attempted to answer or not.
